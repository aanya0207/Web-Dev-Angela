<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a driven and ambitious individual navigating the exciting yet demanding journey of my final year as a student. 
  My academic interests are diverse, ranging from technical domains like data analysis, machine learning, and cloud
  computing to my deep passion for the Spanish language. I thrive on structure and purpose, meticulously planning
  my days to balance multiple priorities—be it solving challenging DSA problems, preparing for exams, or honing 
  my programming skills. My long-term vision involves building a fulfilling life in Europe, where I can combine
  my professional aspirations with cultural exploration and personal growth. </p>
  
  <p>I believe in a holistic approach to life, blending my learning and career goals with activities that nurture 
    my well-being. My daily routine reflects this balance, with time dedicated to exercise, mindfulness, and 
    creative outlets like art and journaling. Whether I am exploring new technologies, diving into psychology, or 
    mastering Spanish, I am constantly striving to grow and improve. I dream of not just excelling in the tech world 
    but also teaching Spanish part-time, contributing to communities, and embracing a lifestyle that’s as enriching 
    as it is meaningful.</p>
  
  <p>Above all, I am someone who believes in making every effort count. From preparing for the TCS NQT and deepening 
    my knowledge of cloud strategies to working on innovative projects like potato detection using FastAPI, 
    I am focused on combining persistence with passion. My journey is not just about reaching milestones but also 
    about learning and evolving along the way, step by step, with optimism and determination. </p>
