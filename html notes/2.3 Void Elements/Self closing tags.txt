What are Void Elements?
------------------------

Definition: HTML elements that do not have closing tags and cannot contain any content.
Structure: They are self-closing. Example:
html
<hr />
Starts and ends with angle brackets (< >).
Includes a forward slash (/) just before the closing angle bracket.

Horizontal Line (<hr />)
------------------------
Creates a horizontal line separating sections of content.



Break (<br />):
-----------------
Inserts a line break within a paragraph.


Do's and Don'ts with Void Elements
-------------------------------------
DO:
Use <br /> for content requiring line breaks within the same paragraph (e.g., poems, addresses).
Use <hr /> for visual separation of content.

DON'T:
Use <br /> to create a new paragraph. Instead, use <p> for separate paragraphs for better accessibility.

HTML5 Considerations
----------------------
Void elements like <br> and <hr> can be written without the forward slash (/):
