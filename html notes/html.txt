What is HTML ?
---------------
-> HTML is the foundation of web development.
-> Browsers like Chrome,Safari and Brave render HTML,CSS or JavaScripts files into websites.
-> Early websites are built entirely with HTML.
-> Defines the content & structure of a website.
-> Full form of HTML : Hyper Text Markup Language 
-> HyperText : connects different web page
-> Markup Lang : tags & annotations in the document that define structure & formatting.

The Heading Element
--------------------
<h1> -> opening tags
</h1> -> closing tags

<h1>Heading 1</h1> 
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 1</h6>

Rules: 1. One `<h1>` Rule:
   - A webpage should have only one `<h1>`.
   - Think of `<h1>` as the book title, representing the main topic of the page.

2. Hierarchy:
   - Use headings in order: `<h1>` → `<h2>` → `<h3>` → ... → `<h6>`.
   - Avoid skipping levels (e.g., don’t jump from `<h1>` to `<h3>` without an `<h2>` in between).

3. Semantics and Accessibility:
   - Proper use of headings improves the structure and accessibility of your webpage.

4. Rules Are Not Mandatory:
   - Breaking these rules won’t break your code, but adhering to them is best practice.

5. Professional Reference:
   - Use Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) for detailed information on HTML elements.
