Fonts
-------
Font Size Units: Understand the difference between px, pt, em, and rem.

px and pt are absolute units, while em and rem are relative.
em depends on the parent element's font size.
rem is relative to the root font size, making it more predictable.
Font Weights: Can range from 100 to 900, with 400 being normal and 700 being bold.

Font Family: Always include a fallback generic font type (e.g., serif, sans-serif).

Custom Fonts: Use resources like Google Fonts to include unique fonts. Add the <link> tag in your HTML and reference the font in your CSS.

Quotation Marks: Use quotation marks around font names containing spaces (e.g., "Times New Roman").
